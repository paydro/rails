module Rails
  # In Rails 3.0, a Rails::Application object was introduced which is nothing more than
  # an Engine but with the responsibility of coordinating the whole boot process.
  #
  # Opposite to Rails::Engine, you can only have one Rails::Application instance
  # in your process and both Rails::Application and YourApplication::Application
  # points to it.
  #
  # In other words, Rails::Application is Singleton and whenever you are accessing
  # Rails::Application.config or YourApplication::Application.config, you are actually 
  # accessing YourApplication::Application.instance.config.
  #
  # == Initialization
  #
  # Rails::Application is responsible for executing all railties, engines and plugin
  # initializers. Besides, it also executed some bootstrap initializers (check
  # Rails::Application::Bootstrap) and finishing initializers, after all the others
  # are executed (check Rails::Application::Finisher).
  #
  # == Configuration
  #
  # Besides providing the same configuration as Rails::Engine and Rails::Railtie,
  # the application object has several specific configurations, for example
  # "allow_concurrency", "cache_classes", "consider_all_requests_local", "filter_parameters",
  # "logger", "metals", "reload_engines", "reload_plugins" and so forth.
  #
  # Check Rails::Application::Configuration to see them all.
  #
  # == Routes
  #
  # The application object is also responsible for holding the routes and reloading routes
  # whenever the files change in development.
  #
  # == Middlewares and metals
  #
  # The Application is also responsible for building the middleware stack and setting up
  # both application and engines metals.
